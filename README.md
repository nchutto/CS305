# CS 305 Portfolio Submission

This repository contains my artifact for CS 305: Practices for Secure Software.  
I selected my **Project Two: Practices for Secure Software Report** as the artifact.  
This report demonstrates my ability to write secure communications, refactor code to meet software security protocols, and apply testing tools like OWASP Dependency-Check.

## Reflection

**Who was the client, and what issue did they want addressed?**  
The client was **Artemis Financial**, a consulting company that develops individualized financial plans. They wanted to modernize their web application and ensure secure communication channels for protecting client financial data.  

**What did I do well, and why is secure coding important?**  
I implemented secure communication using SSL/TLS with a self-signed certificate, integrated SHA-256 for checksum verification, and applied dependency scanning with OWASP Dependency-Check. Secure coding is important because it protects sensitive information and reduces risks of breaches or financial/reputational damage.  

**Which part of the vulnerability assessment was challenging or helpful?**  
Distinguishing meaningful vulnerabilities from the long list of flagged items was the most challenging but also helpful. It gave me practice in analyzing scan reports critically and prioritizing fixes.  

**How did I increase layers of security, and what would I use in the future?**  
I added encryption, secure communication via HTTPS, and dependency scanning. In the future, Iâ€™d expand security layers with penetration testing, static code analysis, and continuous monitoring in CI/CD pipelines.  

**How did I ensure functionality and security after refactoring?**  
I reran the refactored code and confirmed it executed without errors, then rechecked dependencies to ensure no new vulnerabilities were introduced. Automated testing verified functionality was intact.  

**What resources, tools, or practices will help in the future?**  
Tools like OWASP Dependency-Check, SSL/TLS certificate management, and secure configuration practices will be useful in future projects.  

**What might I show employers from this assignment?**  
I can show the completed secure software practices report as an example of my ability to integrate encryption, apply vulnerability scanning tools, and follow industry best practices. It demonstrates both technical implementation and written documentation skills.
